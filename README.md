Normalisation_SCFAs

Code for reproducing the statistical analysis and figures published at “Normalisation of short-chain fatty acid concentration by bacterial count of stool samples improves discrimination between eubiotic and dysbiotic gut microbiota samples”. The code is organised in the following order:
-	Bacterial count analysis (including preliminary tests and the density plot of the total bacterial count)
-	Analysis of sample stability
-	Normalisation of SCFAs levels (and the boxplots comparing eubiotic and dysbiotic patients)
-	Density plots and ROC curves of SCFAs (acetate, propionate and butyrate)
-	Supplementary materials
